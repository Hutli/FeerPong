# FeerPong
F-klubbens overengineered og goldplated beerpong table!
For quite a while, two beautifully painted tables has been sitting in the dark corners of j√¶gerstuen, ready to be turned into the nerdiest (and therefore also, coolest) beerpong tables known to man. This reposotory has therefore been created to conquer this stalemate and bring the dream to life. Currently it is a bit empty in here, but in the future we will collect everything relating to the FeerPong table in here. This will include, but in not limited to, 3D files for the lasercutter that will ingrave the table (already here, woop!), code to the ontable-hardware and, of cause, documentation for it all.

## FeerPong ideas:
- F-klubbens logo encompassing the beers ingraved into the tables via lasercutting
  - See [the 2D logo lasercutting files](PhysicalDesign/2DLogoLaserCutting)
- Diodes, sensors and ontable-hardware that can be used for various extensions of the traditional beerpong, truly bringing forth the era of FeerPong
  - Game ideas: (You are wellcome to add more!)
    - Holy_Grail_Protocol:
      - Randomly an active cup will light up for a set time, if that cup is hit the team owning the cup will have to drink an extra beer/shot/etc.
  - Crazy new ideas: (Again, add more!)
    - Account creation and cross-game score keeping
    - App/webapp integration for game control, account management etc.
    

(You are also wellcome to correct any spelling-mistakes you find)
