# FeerPong
F-klubbens overengineered og goldplated beerpong table!

For quite a while, two beautifully painted tables have been sitting in the dark corners of j√¶gerstuen, ready to be turned into the nerdiest (and therefore also, coolest) beer pong tables known to man. This repository has therefore been created to conquer this stalemate and bring the dream to life. Currently, it is a bit empty in here, but in the future, we will collect everything relating to the FeerPong table in here. This will include, but not limited to, 2D files for the laser cutter that will engrave the table (already here, whoop!), code to the ontable-hardware and, of course, documentation for it all.

## FeerPong ideas:
- F-klubbens logo encompassing the beers ingraved into the tables via laser cutting
  - See [the 2D logo laser cutting files](PhysicalDesign/2DLogoLaserCutting)
- Diodes, sensors and ontable-hardware that can be used for various extensions of the traditional beer pong, truly bringing forth the era of FeerPong
  - Game ideas: (You are welcome to add more!)
    - Holy_Grail_Protocol:
      - Randomly an active cup will light up for a set time if that cup is hit the team owning the cup will have to drink an extra beer/shot/etc.
  - Crazy new ideas: (Again, add more!)
    - Account creation and cross-game score keeping
    - App/web-app integration for game control, account management etc.
